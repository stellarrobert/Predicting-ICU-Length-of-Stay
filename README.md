# Predicting-ICU-Length-of-Stay



For hospitals, a patients’ length of stay (LOS) is a major determinant of the cost. Understanding the attributes associated with LOS is vital for any account striving to improve efficiency. Lowering LOS can dramatically reduce costs and increase the number of patients a hospital can treat in a given period of time. 
Furthermore, the goal was to understand how much predictive information exists on patients’ LOS at the time of admission versus at the time of discharge. 


This analysis utilizes the MIMIC-III database. This is a large, publicly-available database curated by MIT, though it does require permission and a training course to gain access. It contains deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
