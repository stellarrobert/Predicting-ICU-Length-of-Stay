# Predicting-ICU-Length-of-Stay

For hospitals, a patients’ length of stay (LOS) is a major determinant of the cost. Understanding the attributes associated with LOS is vital for any account striving to improve efficiency. Lowering LOS can dramatically reduce costs and increase the number of patients a hospital can treat in a given period of time. 
Furthermore, the goal was to understand how much predictive information exists on patients’ LOS at the time of admission versus at the time of discharge. 
For this analysis, we will be using the MIMIC III dataset. This is a publicly available dataset curated by MIT, though it does require permission and a training course to gain access.
